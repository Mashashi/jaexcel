This git repository was built and tested with eclipse-rcp-mars-2-win32 using Java7. In this build of eclipse it is also advisable to install EMF in order to build the project correctly.

Dependencies added directly on the repository and not via some package manager system due to technical reasons that made the build of the software overly complicated.
